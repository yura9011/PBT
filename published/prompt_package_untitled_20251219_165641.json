    "original_template": "**TYPE:** RETRO-ANIME_CEL_ILLUSTRATION // 1990s_OVA_AESTHETIC **SUBJECT_GEOMETRY:** Two female figures in a confined corridor setting. 1. **Foreground Subject (Primary):** Positioned right-of-center, 3/4 dorsal view (view from back), twisting torso to look back over left shoulder in sharp profile. Angular jawline, narrow almond eyes with heavy upper lash line, small nose. Hair is voluminous, straight, jet-black with blunt bangs, cascading down the back. Attire: Black long-sleeved cropped turtleneck, high-waisted pleated miniskirt in vivid pink/black tartan, black thigh-high stockings. Right arm obscured, left arm hanging straight down holding a dark bag. 2. **Background Subject (Secondary):** Framed within a dark rectangular doorway on the left. Frontal stance, leaning slightly against the doorframe. Short black hair with distinct bangs. Expression is surprised/alert (wide eyes, small open mouth). Attire: Cropped mustard-yellow jacket with quilted shoulders, black fishnet midriff top over a solid black bandeau, high-cut black bikini bottoms. 3. **Environment:** A flat wall plane on the left with a rectangular intercom box/panel. A dark doorway opening behind the secondary figure. **MEDIUM_AND_TEXTURE:** * **Substrate:** Simulation of an animation cel (acetate) layered over a hand-painted gouache background, then scanned. * **Texture Overlay:** Heavy, visible canvas/linen grain texture (approx. 300gsm weave) affecting the entire image, mimicking a scan of a physical textured print or canvas board. * **Line Work:** Sharp, confident G-pen inking. Uniform black contours with minimal variance, typical of animation cels. * **Paint Application:** Flat, solid block coloring (cel-painting style) with absolutely no soft gradients or airbrushing. Shadows are hard-edged shapes. **CHROMATICS:** * **Dominant Background:** Oxidized Olive Green / Toxic Slime Green (#4A6E26) for the corridor walls. * **Accents:** Electric Magenta / Hot Pink (#E33D66) for the plaid skirt. Mustard Ochre / Warning Yellow (#D6B938) for the background jacket. * **Neutrals:** Void Black (#050505) for hair and tops. Cool Porcelain Ivory (#FCEFE6) for skin tones. * **Details:** Matte White (#F0F0F0) for the intercom box. Deep Maroon (#4A0E18) for the background void. Small pop of Ruby Red (#D11818) for the foreground figure's earring. **ATMOSPHERE_AND_LIGHTING:** * **Lighting Style:** Classic 90s anime hard light. Directional light source from the right, casting sharp, black drop-shadows on the left side of the figures and clothing folds. * **Mood:** Suspenseful, \"caught in the act,\" retro-pop noir. * **Artifacting:** Slight analog noise and color bleed, vintage scan fidelity.",
