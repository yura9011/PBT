    "variable_explanations": {
        "PRODUCT_AND_MATERIAL": "Defines the subject and its physical texture. This is critical for DALL-E 3's material rendering engine (e.g., 'Brushed aluminum credit card holder', 'Ceramic vase with high-gloss glaze', 'Custom woven patch on raw denim').",
        "NEW_WAVE_DESIGN_MOTIF": "Sets the stylistic context and background elements, anchoring the image in the New-Wave aesthetic (e.g., 'Memphis Group geometric patterns', 'Vaporwave gradient and neon grid', 'Faux-marble pedestal and chrome accents').",
        "COMPOSITION_AND_LENS_CHOICE": "Controls the perspective, framing, and depth of field. Using specific lens terminology dictates compression and bokeh quality (e.g., 'Medium close-up, 85mm telephoto compression, razor-thin DoF', 'Overhead flat lay, 50mm equivalent', 'Low perspective wide-angle, strong leading lines').",
        "LIGHTING_SCHEME_AND_SHADOWS": "Determines the drama, mood, and how texture is revealed. Specific schemes like 'split lighting' or 'chiaroscuro' yield predictable results (e.g., 'Hard key light creating distinct cast shadows', 'Softbox diffused fill light, minimal shadow detail', 'Contre-jour with strong rim lighting').",
        "COLOR_PALETTE_AND_ATMOSPHERE": "Guides the overall color harmony and emotional tone, using technical color theory language (e.g., 'Triadic palette (magenta, cyan, yellow), vibrant studio mood', 'Monochromatic teal and pale gold accents, crisp atmosphere', 'Analogous earth tones, nostalgic and muted mood')."

    "examples": [
        "A realistic product shot of a matte black ceramic moisturizer jar with gold foil lettering displayed on a surface incorporating Asymmetric, zig-zag checkerboard patterns and pastel geometric solids (Memphis influence). The composition is defined by a Ultra-close macro shot, 105mm prime lens, tight depth of field, utilizing Hard, directional rim lighting with deep, sharp shadows cast onto the background to emphasize texture and form.

The scene uses a Desaturated slate gray, rust orange, and deep black, gritty and austere atmosphere. Focus on material fidelity, specular highlights, and chromatic aberration typical of high-end commercial photography.",
        "A realistic product shot of a frosted glass bottle of artisanal soda with iridescent foil labels displayed on a surface incorporating Pixelated starbursts and geometric wave patterns reminiscent of early digital art. The composition is defined by a Dynamic diagonal composition, medium shot, captured with a tilt-shift lens for selective focus, utilizing High-key lighting, soft, diffused light minimizing shadows, focusing on translucency to emphasize texture and form. The scene uses a Bubblegum pink, sky blue, and bright yellow, clean and slightly saccharine atmosphere. Focus on material fidelity, specular highlights, and chromatic aberration typical of high-end commercial photography.",
        "A realistic product shot of a sculpted concrete incense burner with brass accents displayed on a surface incorporating Abstract primary color blocks (red, yellow, blue) intersecting with bold, thick black lines (Bauhaus meets 80s graphic design). The composition is defined by a Vertically oriented close-up, shot with a 85mm portrait lens, slightly below eye level, utilizing Split lighting (half bright, half shadow) emphasizing the harsh texture of the concrete to emphasize texture and form. The scene uses a Earth tones (beige, terracotta) contrasted sharply with primary cyan and magenta accents, sophisticated and art-focused atmosphere. Focus on material fidelity, specular highlights, and chromatic aberration typical of high-end commercial photography."

            "tip": "Specify material states (e.g., 'high-gloss glaze', 'raw denim', 'brushed aluminum').",
            "reason": "DALL-E 3 excels at differentiating tactile textures. Using specific material terms drastically improves the fidelity of light interaction (specular maps and reflectivity), which is crucial for commercial realism."

        {
            "tip": "Use lens terminology (e.g., '85mm telephoto compression', 'razor-thin DoF', 'wide-angle perspective').",
            "reason": "These terms directly control the visual perspective and depth of field (bokeh). Specific focal lengths help manage background separation and product scale, preventing the image from looking flat or generic."
        },
        {
            "tip": "Avoid generalized lighting terms; use directional/quality terms (e.g., 'Hard key light', 'Contre-jour', 'Softbox diffused fill').",
            "reason": "DALL-E 3 understands the physical properties of light setup. Specifying the quality (hard vs. soft) and direction (rim, key, fill) ensures accurate shadow placement and texture emphasis, which is the hallmark of professional product photography."
