The hook ('Generate amazing, high-detail hero shots...') is adequate but not compelling enough to maximize marketplace clicks. Crucially, the description fails to explicitly list the powerful technical features (8k Resolution, Unreal Engine 5 implementation) that are present in the template. These features must be highlighted to justify the quality claim. Use cases are clearly specified. (11/15)"
