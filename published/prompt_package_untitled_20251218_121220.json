            "title_quality": "The title 'Cinematic Noir Portrait' is strong, concise (3 words), and effectively uses 'Cinematic Noir' as a powerful visual descriptor. The use of 'Portrait' clearly defines the output type. The only minor point deduction (1 point) is for the slightly ambiguous subject-type combination where 'portrait' could be interpreted as the subject rather than the output type for a variable subject. A title like 'Cinematic Noir {Subject} Portrait' would be more explicit, but the current format is highly functional.",
            "template_structure": "The template structure is excellent. The variable `{subject}` is clearly marked and positioned correctly. The core style descriptors ('dramatic, high-contrast, deep shadows, stark highlights, cinematic lighting') make up a significant portion of the prompt and perfectly align with the 'Cinematic Noir' promise. Technical specifications like 'prime lens' and '8k' are included, providing clear instructions for quality and style. The prompt delivers exactly what the title promises.",
            "variable_examples": "This section requires significant revision. Only 5 examples were provided ('A detective, a lone wolf, a vintage car, a city skyline, a broken heart'), falling short of the required 8-10. While the examples demonstrate good diversity across categories (person, object, animal/metaphor, location, abstract concept), the lack of quantity limits the user's understanding of the prompt's full potential range. The examples provided are high quality, but quantity is a strict requirement for a high-scoring prompt package.",
            "commercial_viability": "The commercial viability is high. The use cases provided ('film posters or graphic novels') are specific and appropriate for the aesthetic generated. The suggested price tier ($1.99) is standard for a quality, style-specific prompt. The unique value proposition of combining 'Cinematic Noir' with high-contrast rendering creates a distinct product in a competitive marketplace, avoiding generic output.",
            "description_quality": "The description quality is adequate but could be improved for marketplace readiness. The hook 'Generate stunning noir portraits' is functional but lacks a compelling emotional draw. The description accurately specifies use cases ('perfect for film posters or graphic novels'). However, it fails to explicitly list the technical features included in the prompt itself (e.g., 'high-contrast, moody images' is good, but mentioning '8k resolution' or 'prime lens' would be more persuasive and informative for the buyer).",

                "Refine the title to explicitly include the variable in a placeholder format (e.g., 'Cinematic Noir {Subject} Portrait') for maximum clarity, though this is a minor adjustment."
