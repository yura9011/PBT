The only minor deduction is for the structure not strictly following the [Descriptor] + [Subject] + [Type] pattern perfectly, though it is highly effective.",
            "TEMPLATE STRUCTURE": "The template is excellent. It uses the `[SUBJECT]` variable clearly, dedicates ample space (over 40%) to high-quality style descriptors (cinematic lighting, Octane render, dystopian future), and includes necessary technical flags like resolution (8k) and aspect ratio (`--ar 16:9`). This structure is highly robust and generation-ready.",
            "VARIABLE EXAMPLES": "This is the primary weakness of the package. Only 6 examples were provided, failing the 8-10 requirement. Furthermore, the examples are heavily focused on specific physical locations (e.g., Skyscraper, Desert Colony) and lack sufficient abstract concepts or categorical diversity (e.g., testing character integration, specific weather effects, or abstract moods). The range demonstrated is too narrow.",
            "COMMERCIAL VIABILITY": "The viability is high. The niche focus on high-fidelity, dystopian concept art serves a clear market (game development, concept artists). The suggested price tier ($2.99) is appropriate for the quality and specificity of the prompt, representing strong value.",
            "DESCRIPTION QUALITY": "The description provides a compelling hook and correctly identifies the primary use cases. However, it fails to adequately list the technical features that define the prompt's quality (e.g., Octane, 8k, 16:9, volumetric fog). Relying only on generic terms like 'Fast rendering' undersells the complexity and power of the underlying template.",
