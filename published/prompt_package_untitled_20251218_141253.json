However, it fails to strictly adhere to the required pattern: [Descriptor] + [Subject] + [Type]. It should be closer to 'Moody Cinematic Portrait Template' to clearly identify the deliverable as a reusable prompt template, not just a generator utility. The score reflects a solid, but slightly inaccurate, title.",
            "template_structure": "The template is highly effective, utilizing strong style descriptors (40% of the prompt space) and clearly marking the variable as [SUBJECT]. The core aesthetic promise is delivered. The only deduction is for technical specifications: while '--ar 16:9' and '--style raw' are present, the prompt omits crucial versioning information (e.g., --v 6.0) or specific lens/camera model details that could further lock in the cinematic style.",
            "variable_examples": "This section is the weakest link. Only 6 examples were provided, failing the minimum requirement of 8-10. Furthermore, the examples included subjects that break the core promise ('futuristic city' when the template is strictly a 'portrait' generator), confusing the user about the template's limitations. The diversity is moderate, but the lack of quantity and the inclusion of off-topic subjects significantly lowered the score.",
            "commercial_viability": "The use case identified ('social media') is too narrow and common. The suggested price tier ($1.99) is too low for a sophisticated, high-quality template; a price point of $2.99 - $4.99 is more appropriate for marketplace entry. The unique value proposition (UVP) is weak, as 'Cinematic Portrait' is highly saturated. A specific niche (e.g., 'Neo-Noir 1980s 70mm Cinematic Portraits') is needed to justify commercial interest.",
            "description_quality": "The description included a serviceable hook ('Get stunning profile pictures instantly!'), but lacked necessary technical depth. It failed to clearly list all constraints (e.g., model compatibility, required aspect ratio). The use cases were too limited, focusing only on personal use rather than expanded commercial applications (e.g., concept art, book covers, advertising mockups)."
