It uses 'Vibrant Neon' as the emotional/visual descriptor, identifies 'Cityscape' as the subject, and clearly states 'Generator' as the output type. The length of four words is optimal for marketplace searchability.",
            "template_structure": "The template structure is highly effective. The subject variable `[Subject]` is clearly marked and positioned correctly. The core style descriptors (e.g., 'cyberpunk aesthetic,' 'high-contrast cinematic lighting') comprise a significant portion of the prompt, ensuring consistent stylistic output. Technical specifications are well-defined, though for maximum versatility across all possible variable inputs, a slight refinement to ensure a consistent aspect ratio and lighting model across diverse subjects (e.g., ensuring 'daytime' subjects still have a neon glow) would make this truly flawless. The prompt is fully consistent with the title's promise.",
            "variable_examples": "The provided examples demonstrate excellent range. The inclusion of specific locations ('Shibuya Crossing,' 'Times Square'), categorical inputs ('Futuristic floating city,' 'Rain-slicked back alley'), and abstract concepts ('Ancient ruins reimagined with neon') effectively showcases the template's versatility and robustness. The quantity (9 examples) is sufficient to illustrate its full potential.",

The use cases provided—game assets, graphic design elements, and high-quality wallpapers—are clearly defined and appropriate for the generated output. The suggested price tier ($3.99) is justified by the high quality and niche aesthetic of the prompt. The unique value proposition of generating 'consistent, high-resolution cyberpunk art assets' addresses a clear market demand.",
            "description_quality": "The description is compelling and professional. It opens with a strong hook that immediately identifies the target user and output quality. The technical features are accurately listed, highlighting key selling points like resolution and specific lighting effects. The use cases are clearly specified, guiding potential buyers on how to utilize the prompt effectively."
