            "TITLE QUALITY": "Score: 20/20. The title, 'Cinematic Cyberpunk Character Portraits,' is perfect. It follows the [Descriptor] + [Subject] + [Type] pattern, uses the evocative descriptor 'Cinematic,' is exactly four words, and clearly defines the output as 'Portraits.'",
            "TEMPLATE STRUCTURE": "Score: 30/30. The template is exceptionally well-structured and optimized. The [Subject] variable is clearly demarcated. Stylistic descriptors ('volumetric lighting,' 'high contrast,' 'neon accents') form a robust core, and the technical specifications ('8k,' '--ar 4:5,' '--style raw') ensure high fidelity and control. It fully delivers on the 'Cinematic Cyberpunk' promise.",
            "VARIABLE EXAMPLES": "Score: 19/20. Eight strong, diverse examples were provided, covering various roles like 'hacker,' 'street samurai,' and 'android bartender.' This demonstrates excellent range. However, for a perfect score, the prompt requires 9-10 examples. While the mix of specific (roles) and categorical (executive, cyborg) is good, including one more truly abstract or conceptual subject (e.g., 'A sentient algorithm manifested as light') would solidify the range coverage.",
            "COMMERCIAL VIABILITY": "Score: 15/15. This prompt targets a highly popular and commercially valuable niche (Cyberpunk character design). Use cases (concept art, profile pictures, graphic novels) are clear and align perfectly with the output. The suggested mid-to-high price tier ($3.99 hypothetical) is appropriate given the technical quality and strong style adherence. High marketplace potential.",
            "DESCRIPTION QUALITY": "Score: 15/15. The description is concise and compelling. The hook ('Dive into the neon-drenched future!') is strong. Technical features (lighting, aspect ratio control) are highlighted, and specific use cases are clearly listed. This is an effective sales copy."
