        "Explicitly command the use of 'shallow depth of field (DoF)' or 'selective focus' alongside 'bokeh' to ensure the background is sufficiently blurred. This mimics professional macro product photography and forces the focus onto the tactile layers.",
        "When specifying lighting (e.g., 'Raking Light,' 'Contre-Jour'), always include the visual goal ('to exaggerate surface imperfections' or 'create strong rim light'). This reinforces the desired effect of enhancing dimensionality and texture relief.",
        "Avoid instructing the image to look like a 'digital render.' Frame the request as a 'photograph' or 'still life' to maintain the desired physical, material realism, even though the final product is a digital kit."

            "**Explicit Photographic Parameters:** While the template uses excellent descriptive photographic language (DoF, Raking Light), adding explicit technical specifications (e.g., `shot on 85mm lens`, `f/1.2`, `high resolution scan`) would further lock in the professional product photography aesthetic and ensure consistency across various AI models (Midjourney V6, SDXL). This strengthens the `extreme shallow depth of field` mandate.",

For example, clarify that `KIT_MATERIAL_PALETTE` should consist of 3-5 highly descriptive, textural nouns, and that `TONAL_TREATMENT_AND_PATINA` requires specific color relationships (e.g., 'Analogous Pastel Palette', 'Split Complementary'). This helps novice users maximize the prompt's potential.",

It successfully segments the creative process into five highly controllable, high-impact variables (Material, Composition, Lighting, Tone, Backdrop). The use of highly specific photographic terminology (e.g., 'Low-Key Raking Light,' 'Hard, Directional Split Lighting,' 'extreme shallow depth of field') ensures that the resulting image output is consistently high-quality, hyper-realistic, and achieves the desired tactile materiality. The diversity of the provided examples proves the template's robustness and flexibility across different aesthetic requirements.
