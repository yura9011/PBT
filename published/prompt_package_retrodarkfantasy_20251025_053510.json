It strictly adheres to the required pattern ([Descriptor] + [Subject] + [Type]), uses strong visual descriptors ('Gritty,' 'Cinematic'), is concise (4 words), and clearly defines the output ('Portraits'). This title is highly searchable and compelling.",
            "TEMPLATE STRUCTURE": "The template is robust and professional. The subject variable is clearly marked and isolated ({subject}). The prompt is heavily weighted towards style (volumetric lighting, deep shadows, cinematic atmosphere), ensuring high artistic consistency. Crucially, the technical specifications (8k resolution, ARRI Alexa 65, 50mm lens) are specific and directly support the 'Cinematic' promise, making this template highly effective and consistent with the title.",
            "VARIABLE EXAMPLES": "Nine diverse examples were provided, meeting the required quantity. The examples demonstrate excellent range, spanning specific character archetypes (space marine, architect), abstract concepts (mysterious cloaked figure), and non-human subjects (ancient robot, majestic owl). This mix effectively showcases the versatility of the cinematic style across various genres (Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Contemporary).",
            "COMMERCIAL VIABILITY": "The commercial assessment is strong. Use cases (book covers, game concept art) are clearly defined and align perfectly with the high-fidelity, dramatic output. The suggested price tier ($2.99) is appropriate for a highly technical and niche style prompt. The unique value proposition—delivering a consistent 'ARRI Alexa 65' film look—is a clear differentiator in the marketplace.",
            "DESCRIPTION QUALITY": "The description is highly effective. It starts with a compelling hook ('Need ultra-realistic, dramatic character art?'). It clearly lists the key technical features (volumetric lighting, specific camera data) that justify the quality.
