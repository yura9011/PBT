        "A minimalist product visualization of a wireless charging pad made of brushed aluminum and frosted glass. Framed using a perfect isometric view against a wall and floor junction. Illumination is achieved via a soft box studio light emphasizing subtle edge highlights. The product interacts with a subtle texture environment defined by smooth matte ceramic texture with slight imperfections. Overall aesthetic utilizes a monochromatic serene palette of cool grays and muted blues.",
        "A minimalist product visualization of a cylindrical black lipstick tube with gold lettering. Framed using an extreme macro close-up, focusing on the texture of the cap. Illumination is achieved via a hard rim light creating a stark outline and deep shadows. The product interacts with a subtle texture environment defined by highly polished chrome reflection mapping. Overall aesthetic utilizes a high-contrast cinematic mood using deep blacks and vibrant reds.",
        "A minimalist product visualization of a three-legged oak side table with rounded edges. Framed using a low-angle shot, emphasizing height and structure. Illumination is achieved via volumetric god rays streaming from an unseen window. The product interacts with a subtle texture environment defined by distressed linen fabric draped subtly in the background. Overall aesthetic utilizes an earthy muted academic palette of olive green and terracotta.",
        "A minimalist product visualization of a single, geometrically perfect glazed donut. Framed using a perfect overhead flat lay composition. Illumination is achieved via diffused, even top-down lighting. The product interacts with a subtle texture environment defined by fine sand texture serving as the grounding element. Overall aesthetic utilizes a pastel playful palette using soft pinks, mint greens, and lavender.",
        "A minimalist product visualization of a complex modular synthesizer unit with exposed wiring. Framed using a dynamic Dutch angle perspective from below. Illumination is achieved via dual-source neon glow (magenta and cyan). The product interacts with a subtle texture environment defined by wet, reflective concrete roughness. Overall aesthetic utilizes a vibrant retro 80s aesthetic with saturated electric colors."

    "tips": [
        "Explicitly use terms like 'negative space' or 'void' in the composition variable. DALL-E 3 tends to fill backgrounds; strong commands for emptiness ensure the minimalist focus is maintained.",
        "Specify the material texture fidelity (e.g., 'matte gesso-white,' 'polished travertine'). This instructs the model to prioritize realistic material rendering over stylistic abstraction, crucial for believable mockups.",
        "Define the focus technique (e.g., 'critical focus,' 'extreme shallow depth of field'). This mimics professional lens work, ensuring the product is razor-sharp while the background dissolves naturally, enhancing the product's prominence.",
        "Use specific lighting modifiers (e.g., 'soft box,' 'Fresnel spotlight,' 'raking light'). This moves beyond general 'good lighting' and directs DALL-E to simulate actual studio setups, guaranteeing controlled shadows and realistic highlights."

    "description": "This template is engineered for generating clean, highly focused product mockups suitable for e-commerce listings, emphasizing material fidelity and controlled lighting. The 'less is more' aesthetic is achieved by prioritizing negative space and specific technical photographic controls.",
