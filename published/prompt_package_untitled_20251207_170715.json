            "TITLE QUALITY": "The title 'Vibrant Retro Sci-Fi Illustrations' is concise (4 words), includes strong visual and thematic descriptors ('Vibrant Retro Sci-Fi'), and clearly states the output type ('Illustrations'). It effectively communicates the prompt's essence. However, for strict adherence to the '[Descriptor] + [Subject] + [Type]' pattern, the 'Subject' component is implied rather than explicitly stated. While this is a common and effective marketplace practice for general-purpose style prompts, a title like 'Vibrant Retro Sci-Fi Character Illustrations' or 'Vibrant Retro Sci-Fi Scene Illustrations' would more literally fulfill the pattern. A minor deduction has been applied for this technicality.",
            "TEMPLATE STRUCTURE": "The template structure is exemplary. The `[Subject]` variable is prominently and clearly marked, indicating where user input should be placed. Core style descriptors such as 'vibrant retro sci-fi illustration, 1980s aesthetic, synthwave colors, neon glow, intricate details, futuristic city backdrop, highly detailed, cinematic lighting' constitute a substantial portion of the prompt (well over 40%), ensuring a consistent and rich aesthetic. Technical specifications like 'octane render, 8k, --ar 16:9 --style raw' are complete, relevant, and enhance output quality and control. The prompt's content is perfectly consistent with the title's promise, delivering exactly what is advertised.",
            "VARIABLE EXAMPLES": "The prompt package provides an excellent selection of 10 diverse variable examples, meeting the required quantity. These examples showcase a strong mix of specific subjects ('A sleek chrome spaceship', 'An android detective in a rain-soaked alley'), abstract concepts ('A quantum computer interface', 'A portal to another dimension'), and categorical entities ('A holographic cityscape', 'A cybernetic organism'). This range effectively demonstrates the versatility and breadth of outputs achievable with the prompt, inspiring potential users.",
            "COMMERCIAL VIABILITY": "Commercial viability is thoroughly addressed. The identified use cases—album art, game assets, desktop backgrounds, social media banners, print-on-demand designs, and book covers—are highly relevant and provide clear value propositions for a broad audience. The suggested mid-tier price range ($4.99 - $9.99) is appropriate for a high-quality, niche-specific prompt that delivers consistent, professional-grade results. The unique value proposition clearly articulates the benefit of consistent, authentic retro sci-fi art, saving time for creatives and designers.",
            "DESCRIPTION QUALITY": "The description is well-structured and compelling. It opens with an engaging hook, 'Blast off into a neon-drenched future with 'Vibrant Retro Sci-Fi Illustrations'!', immediately capturing interest and setting the thematic tone. Technical features, including 'Consistent 80s retro sci-fi art style', 'High-resolution (8k) outputs', 'Cinematic lighting', and specific parameters like '--ar 16:9' and '--style raw', are clearly listed and explained, informing users of the prompt's capabilities. The specified use cases are comprehensively detailed, guiding potential buyers on practical applications and reinforcing the prompt's commercial appeal."

        "priority_improvements": [
            "While highly effective, consider refining the title to explicitly include a placeholder or a general subject (e.g., 'Vibrant Retro Sci-Fi [Subject] Illustrations' or 'Vibrant Retro Sci-Fi Scene Illustrations') to more strictly adhere to the '[Descriptor] + [Subject] + [Type]' pattern, even though the current title performs well in practice."
