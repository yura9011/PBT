            "TITLE QUALITY": "The title 'Mystic Forest Whispers' is evocative but fails to follow the [Descriptor] + [Subject] + [Type] pattern. It lacks a clear subject and output type. While it has an emotional descriptor and is within the word count, the lack of structure significantly impacts its clarity and discoverability. The word count is 3 words, which is on the lower end of the 3-6 word requirement.",
            "TEMPLATE STRUCTURE": "The subject variable 'Forest' is clearly marked. However, the core style descriptors only constitute about 25% of the prompt, falling short of the 40% requirement. Technical specifications are present but could be more comprehensive. The template is mostly consistent with the title's promise, but the lack of detailed stylistic elements hinders its full potential.",
            "VARIABLE EXAMPLES": "The prompt provides 7 diverse examples, which is slightly below the 8-10 requirement. The examples include a mix of specific ('Ancient Oak', 'Glimmering Stream'), abstract ('Ethereal Glow', 'Whispering Leaves'), and categorical ('Magical Creatures', 'Hidden Paths'). However, the range of examples could be broader, particularly in terms of mood and complexity.",
            "COMMERCIAL VIABILITY": "Clear use cases are identified, such as 'fantasy art', 'game assets', and 'book illustrations'. The suggested price tier seems appropriate for the complexity offered. However, the unique value proposition could be more strongly articulated; it's not entirely clear what sets this prompt apart from others generating similar imagery.",
            "DESCRIPTION QUALITY": "The description starts with a decent hook, aiming to draw the user in. Technical features are listed, but could be more detailed and organized. Use cases are specified, which is good. However, the overall description lacks polish and doesn't fully convey the depth and potential of the prompt."
