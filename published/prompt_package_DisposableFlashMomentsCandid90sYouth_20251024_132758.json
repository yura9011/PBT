The image utilizes the raw aesthetic of disposable camera photography. Extreme close-up, low angle framing, illuminated exclusively by direct on-camera flash, resulting in severe light falloff and blown highlights with deep, crushed shadows. The visual texture is defined by intense film grain, color shifts characteristic of expired film, and visible light leaks, rendered with the materiality of Kodak Gold 200, heavy sprocket holes visible, blurry fingerprint smudges.",
        "A candid documentation of a lone figure staring intensely at their reflection in a cracked bathroom mirror, capturing unposed spontaneity in a dimly lit, pastel-tiled motel bathroom at 3 AM. The image utilizes the raw aesthetic of disposable camera photography. Over-the-shoulder view, slightly askew framing, illuminated exclusively by rear curtain sync flash, resulting in severe light falloff and blown highlights with deep, crushed shadows. The visual texture is defined by intense film grain, color shifts characteristic of expired film, and visible light leaks, rendered with the materiality of Fujifilm Superia 400, significant chemical contamination streaks, heavy vignetting.",
        "A candid documentation of a wild coyote caught mid-stride, eyes reflecting the light, capturing unposed spontaneity in a dense, mist-shrouded forest clearing just after midnight. The image utilizes the raw aesthetic of disposable camera photography. Wide shot, centered subject framing, illuminated exclusively by multiple external slave flashes triggered simultaneously, resulting in severe light falloff and blown highlights with deep, crushed shadows. The visual texture is defined by intense film grain, color shifts characteristic of expired film, and visible light leaks, rendered with the materiality of Ilford HP5 (pushed to 3200), deep black and white grain, dusty negatives.",
        "A candid documentation of a skateboarder failing a trick, airborne mid-fall, capturing unposed spontaneity in a gritty, graffiti-covered concrete skate park at dusk. The image utilizes the raw aesthetic of disposable camera photography. Worm's eye view, dutch angle framing, illuminated exclusively by stroboscopic flash sequence (frozen motion effect), resulting in severe light falloff and blown highlights with deep, crushed shadows. The visual texture is defined by intense film grain, color shifts characteristic of expired film, and visible light leaks, rendered with the materiality of Agfa Vista 100, magenta color cast, emulsion scratches.",
        "A candid documentation of two children secretly sharing secrets under a heavy wool blanket, capturing unposed spontaneity in a wood-paneled 1980s suburban living room, illuminated only by a static TV screen. The image utilizes the raw aesthetic of disposable camera photography. Tightly cropped, shallow depth of field framing, illuminated exclusively by bounce flash aimed at a nearby white wall, resulting in severe light falloff and blown highlights with deep, crushed shadows. The visual texture is defined by intense film grain, color shifts characteristic of expired film, and visible light leaks, rendered with the materiality of LomoChrome Purple, intense cross-processing colors, edge bleed artifacts."

    "tips": [
        {
            "tip": "Explicitly define the 'crushed shadows' and 'deep black point' but avoid the term 'detailed' when describing shadow areas.",
            "reason": "DALL-E 3 often attempts to add texture/detail everywhere. For true harsh flash realism, the shadows must be featureless voids (crushed blacks), mimicking cheap film's limited dynamic range."
        },
        {
            "tip": "Use specific analog film stock names (e.g., Kodak Gold 400, Fuji Superia 800) in the `[ANALOG_ARTIFACTS_AND_FILM_STOCK]` variable.",
            "reason": "These names guide the model toward specific color palettes, saturation levels, and grain structures that are chemically accurate to the 90s aesthetic, rather than a generic 'vintage' filter."
        },
        {
            "tip": "Incorporate specific imperfections like 'lens flare,' 'chromatic aberration,' 'halo effect,' or 'light leaks' into the `[HARSH_FLASH_TECHNIQUE]` variable.",
            "reason": "Direct flash hitting cheap plastic lenses causes predictable optical flaws. Naming these flaws ensures the image maintains an imperfect, authentic analog feel."
        },
        {
            "tip": "When requesting motion, use terms like 'motion blur and ghosting' (from overlapping flash bursts) rather than 'high speed' or 'frozen action'.",
            "reason": "Disposable cameras typically have slow shutter speeds relative to the flash, leading to visible ambient light trails and subject ghosting, which is a key part of the chaotic aesthetic."

While the current separation is technically precise, combining them might simplify the user input process without sacrificing control, as the two concepts are highly related in this specific aesthetic.",
            "**Explicit Era Tagging:** Although the style descriptors ('disposable camera,' 'expired film') strongly imply the 1990s/Y2K aesthetic, explicitly including a fixed technical tag like `(1990s analog photograph)` or `(Y2K aesthetic)` early in the prompt ensures better semantic understanding by the model and improves search visibility on the marketplace.",

While it is justified, ensure that the total token count remains efficient. No immediate changes are required, but this should be monitored if the model begins to dilute the effect."
