It meets the word count (5 words) and clearly conveys the output type (Portrait). However, 'Generation Guide' is unnecessary filler. A stricter title like 'Epic Cinematic Portrait' would be punchier and more professional for a marketplace listing, resulting in a minor deduction.",

The prompt is rich with high-value core style descriptors (volumetric lighting, deep focus, cinematic color grading) which make up well over 40% of the instruction. Technical specifications are complete, including 8k resolution, camera emulation (Arri Alexa), aspect ratio (`--ar 16:9`), and style modifier (`--style raw`). It perfectly aligns with the 'Cinematic Portrait' promise.",

While the diversity is excellent, covering abstract concepts ('joy' personified), specific characters (Viking warrior), and categorized subjects (golden retriever), the quantity must be met to demonstrate full range and robustness. A deduction is applied for the missing examples.",
            "COMMERCIAL VIABILITY": "The commercial strategy is strong. Clear use cases (Concept art, profile pictures) target high-value user needs. The suggested price ($3.99 - mid-to-high tier) is appropriate given the technical complexity and high-quality output promise. The UVP—delivery of 'Hollywood-level visuals' through specific technical controls—is clearly established.",
            "DESCRIPTION QUALITY": "The description is concise and effective. It starts with a compelling, pain-point-driven hook ('Tired of flat images?').
