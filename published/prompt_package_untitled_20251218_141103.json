        "feedback": {
            "TITLE QUALITY": "Excellent. The title 'Cinematic Sci-Fi Cityscape Concept Art' perfectly adheres to the [Descriptor] + [Subject] + [Type] structure, uses a strong visual descriptor ('Cinematic'), is five words long, and clearly indicates the output type (Concept Art). (20/20)",
            "TEMPLATE STRUCTURE": "The template is highly professional and technically robust. The subject variable is clearly marked as [Subject]. Core style descriptors (photorealistic, volumetric lighting, dramatic atmosphere) constitute a significant portion of the prompt, ensuring consistency. Technical specifications (--ar 16:9, Unreal Engine 5 render, 8k) are complete. The only minor deduction is that the inclusion of 'architectural sketch overlay' slightly detracts from the 'Cinematic' (final render) promise in the title, making the output potentially lean toward a production sketch rather than a finished scene. (29/30)",
            "VARIABLE EXAMPLES": "The package provides 10 examples, fulfilling the quantity requirement. There is a strong mix of specific (Abandoned Tokyo Skyscraper), categorical (Bio-Luminescent Forest Canopy), and abstract (Abstract Geometric Ice Palace) concepts. The examples generally demonstrate a strong range within the environmental concept art niche. However, Example 10 ('A small wooden boat sailing on a calm lake') falls completely outside the promised 'Sci-Fi Cityscape' style, which risks confusing the buyer about the prompt's core strength and optimal use case. (19/20)",
            "COMMERCIAL VIABILITY": "Outstanding. Use cases are clearly defined (AAA game assets, movie pre-production). The suggested premium price tier ($4.99) is justified by the technical complexity and high-fidelity output potential. The unique value proposition of focused, cinematic environment rendering using specific engine terminology is strong. (15/15)",
            "DESCRIPTION QUALITY": "The description is compelling and professional. It opens with an effective hook targeting a common pain point ('Tired of flat, boring concept art?'). It clearly lists the technical features (Unreal Engine 5, 16:9) and specifies the professional use cases (portfolio, game development). (15/15)"

            "Template Consistency Review: Decide if the template should strictly adhere to 'Cinematic Final Render' or 'Cinematic Production Sketch.' If the latter, slightly adjust the title to incorporate 'Sketch' or 'Blueprint' terminology for perfect alignment."
